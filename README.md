How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There are a few techniques that one could use to ensure functional and secure software. Primarily, manual review and thorough testing are going to be two of the best techniques to utilize. There are also automated tests to be utilized that will scan for security vulnerabilities and other related issues. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

One primary way of interpreting user needs is thorough documentation and testing. By having people test the software, you can pinpoint issues and nonfunctional areas of the program. You can also follow certain processes like agile development and writing test cases to better ensure you are meeting user needs properly. 

How do I approach designing software?

I begin by gathering any and all information I can on the project. One of the most important factors to consider in any project is the client. By starting with those needs as a foundation, I can then start writing potential ideas and brainstorming how the program will be setup. This then allows me to begin building the software based off of all my notes and diagrams.
